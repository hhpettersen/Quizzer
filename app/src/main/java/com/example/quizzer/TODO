Create a user node in db:
User: uid, email, username, createdAt, numGames, highscore

Two player game:
1. Find opponent
2. Fetch questions, save in db-node
3. Players can ready up after questions fetched
4. Timer-based, ex 60 sec to complete 10 questions
5. When player is done, update status and score in db
6. When both players are done or time is up, complete game

Create conditional navigation from login, if new user, be able to add username, date of birth, etc...
#Auto-save record if it exceeds previous record, also add date to db
#Display record + date of record and numGames in startFragment
